# GP-SPRNGR - Mount Oglethorpe

Eagles Rest, Jasper, GA
Replacement site for Springer Mountain

## Overview

SPRNGR-1 is where it all starts!

Technically speaking, the site is located at Eagle's Rest atop Mt. Oglethorpe in beautiful Jasper, Georgia. Sitting at an elevation of over 3000 feet ASL, it's one of the highest points in the State of Georgia and is the original terminus of the Appalachian Trail.

Prior AT Golden Packet events took place atop the actual Springer Mountain, however due to development in the area a decision was made to switch to Mt. Oglethorpe as it's the perfect drive-up site. There are several repeaters as well as cellular infrastructure within a stone's throw of a permanent series of picnic tables that are open on all sides yet they are covered from the elements by a very sturdy roof.
